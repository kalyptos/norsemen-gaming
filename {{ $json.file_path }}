Hello everyone!
Every two weeks, we accompany the Roadmap update with a brief explanatory note to give you insight into the decision-making that led to any changes. This is part of an effort to make our communications more transparent, more specific, and more insightful for all of you who help to make Star Citizen and Squadron 42 possible.
Just a reminder: The 1.0 column showcases features and content planned for inclusion in or before Star Citizen 1.0. This means you may not have to wait for the 1.0 release to experience them. As features/content in the 1.0 column become ready, they will migrate left into a point patch column for release.
Be sure to check back every two weeks for the latest updates.
With that, let’s dive into this week’s Roadmap Roundup!
