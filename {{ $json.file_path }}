Avast! A curious sight awaits; reckon ye can make sense of it?
"‘Neath the ground, somethin’ stirs as the storm lashes down. Seek the haunt whose name recalls flames reborn, where legends rise from ashes…
Where hungry crews stop to fill their maws, 
What ye seek be found in lucky draws.
Less than a fleet, more than a lone,
Sharp as cutlasses, these glittering stones.
Blood-red jewels mark the path true,
Count them, matey, n' they'll steer ye through."
-VI
Fly low, and fly fast!

Pirate Orgs of the WeekDuring Pirate Week, we’re putting the spotlight on pirate orgs, highlighting their playstyles, and the feats that made ’em infamous across the ’verse!
BlightVeil
Tempered by piracy, precision, and plunder, BlightVeil has carved a reputation in blood as one of Star Citizen's most dangerous PvP organizations. To fly with BlightVeil means drilling teamfights, executing ruthless fleet operations, and hunting rival orgs in the 'verse's most dangerous zones. 
Famous for waging large-scale combined arms battles, BlightVeil players thrive on discipline, strategy, and the thrill of taking what others can't defend.

Ordre Noir
Meet Ordre Noir, a pirate organization driven by one principle: Purge & PvP. Their mission: total war against the UEE and all Empire-allied organizations steeped in corruption and depravity. To some, they are liberators; to others, outlaws of the stars. Masters of boarding, they also run internally organized roleplay and PvP events, combining tactical skill with immersive storytelling.
In addition to their virtual campaigns, members test new gameplay features, train in piloting and "purging heresy", and participate in in-game events and PU/PTU testing.
Action, camaraderie, and galactic chaos await those who join.
